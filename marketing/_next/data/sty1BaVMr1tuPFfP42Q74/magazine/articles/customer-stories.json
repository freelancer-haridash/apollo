Since then, Kevin&rsquo;s techniques of prioritizing client revenue goals and hyper-personalizing outreach have put Leadium ahead of the game.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re a long-standing leader in SQL appointment setting and revenue growth,&rdquo; Kevin explained. &ldquo;And we have over 500 companies that would agree.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>That success certainly didn&rsquo;t come without challenges along the way. As with any lead generation agency, half the battle was creating and managing a sales system free of redundancy and wrought with automation wherever possible. This process took Kevin down paths he never expected (like, spoiler alert, getting rid of Salesforce).</p>\n<p>But this same grueling process also led Kevin to discover what would eventually become Leadium&rsquo;s backbone to success: Apollo&mdash;and the efficiency, scalability, and flexibility that come with it.</p>\n<p>But first, let&rsquo;s backtrack a few years.</p>\n<h4><strong>Great agencies need great software</strong></h4>\n<p>By 2019, Kevin knew it was time to scale, but also felt that Leadium didn&rsquo;t have the proper tool for the job yet.</p>\n<p>Kevin said, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re a service-based business, but you can&rsquo;t do this business without great software. We asked ourselves: what do we need to build an enterprise-grade system that works not only for our clients but for our needs too?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Their search led to Apollo, which had &ldquo;...more features built-in for an agency like ours&rdquo;. <br><br>This felt appropriate for Leadium&rsquo;s early-stage, top-of-funnel growth production. <br><br>But best of all? Apollo could serve as a centralized source of truth, offering comprehensive data visibility while connecting their most important tools through&nbsp;<a href=\"https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4415734629773-Configure-Access-to-the-Apollo-REST-API\">API access</a>.</p>\n<p>Kevin knew that an open API would allow Leadium to make Apollo their own, and to customize their internal systems to the extreme. It was time to get to work.</p>\n<h4><strong>Cutting the fat: ZoomInfo and Salesforce</strong></h4>\n<p>Over the next few years, Kevin and his team embarked on a journey of cutting the (software) fat and streamlining processes.</p>\n<p>Take ZoomInfo, for example. It was only a matter of months before Leadium realized the long-standing B2B database wasn&rsquo;t all it was cracked up to be.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Kevin explained, <strong>&ldquo;We actually started using ZoomInfo while we were an Apollo user, thinking Zoominfo would be better considering how much they market their data quality. But after three months it wasn&rsquo;t true. It was just too much of a redundancy to what we already had with Apollo, where we&rsquo;ve never had a data quality problem.&rdquo;</strong></p>\n<p>So ZoomInfo was out. And, as Leadium continued to scale, it didn&rsquo;t take long for Salesforce to go too.</p>\n<p>With Apollo automatically managing lead contact records and task management operating seamlessly with an integration through ClickUp, Salesforce simply had no place. Kevin knew it was time to part ways, making Apollo the &ldquo;one true&rdquo; CRM of Leadium.</p>"}},{"type":"shareable_quote","fields":{"quote":"Apollo became the single source of truth for us—where everything originates from and where all the data returns to.","name":"Kevin Warner","title":"Founder and CEO at Leadium"}},{"type":"content","fields":{"content":"<h4><strong>Revolutionizing sales development with open API</strong></h4>\n<p>With ZoomInfo and Salesforce gone, Kevin continued to focus on getting the most out of Apollo&rsquo;s open API by integrating anything and everything he could.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nooks.in/\">Nooks</a> is Leadium&rsquo;s dialer that allows SDRs to call multiple prospects at the same time. <br><br>Instead of manually exporting and uploading information between Nooks and Apollo, Kevin has all 80+ of Leadium&rsquo;s Apollo instances embedded into the tool, allowing all of Apollo&rsquo;s contact data to seamlessly push and pull out of their powerful dialing tool.</p>\n<p>As cool as data synchronization was, Kevin knew this was merely scratching the surface.

Their approach to sales is widely recognized as one of the best.</p>\n<p>So why should their sales stack be any different?</p>\n<h4><strong>Outreach and ZoomInfo: Spending More, Getting Less</strong></h4>\n<p>Prior to Apollo, Predictable Revenue used a combination of Outreach and ZoomInfo, to find new prospects, close deals, and manage current accounts. Collin was a long-time user and follower of Outreach and knew others who used ZoomInfo.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It seemed like a good fit.<br><br><strong>&ldquo;We followed the best practices that everyone recommended with these tools,&rdquo; Collin said, &ldquo;We started with Outreach plugged into Salesforce, but ran into issues pretty quickly.&rdquo;</strong></p>\n<p>As a sales development agency, that combination of tools made technical tasks like managing sub-accounts and creating account rulesets unnecessarily complicated. This forced his team to rely on pricey Salesforce admins to manage what should have been self-serve and easily accessible.</p>\n<p>In an attempt to cut costs, Collin&rsquo;s team went as far as building out a supplementary sales tool. &ldquo;We built our own tool for dashboards, reporting, and SDR performance, so we could drop our Salesforce licenses and pull right from Outreach. It was cheaper for us to do that than to keep paying for the Salesforce integration,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>You heard that right: using multiple tools was so expensive that Predictable Revenue spent additional resources on building its own sales tool.</p>\n<p>A tech stack like this was never going to cut it.
